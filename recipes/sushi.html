    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

    <p>
        Sushi is one of the healthiest foods about, and it's so light too! So sooner or later someone was going to deep fry it and make it the opposite.
        Ok, so this sushi isn't going to soak up tonnes of oil and make every bite an explosion of calories, but it is a little bit naughtier than your standard maki roll. 
        Deep fried maki rolls seem to have been invented in America, and all they really involve is adding a crispy outer shell to your sushi roll, adding to it's luscious appeal!
