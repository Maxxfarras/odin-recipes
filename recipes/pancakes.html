    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>

    <p class="description">
        I found this pancake recipe in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.
        Perfect pancakes are easier to make than you think.
        This pancake recipe produces thick, fluffy, and all-around delicious pancakes with just a few ingredients that are probably already in your kitchen (and it's so much better than the boxed stuff).
